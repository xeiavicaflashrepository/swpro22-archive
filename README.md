# swpro22-archive
Special backup/archive of the swpro22 shareware program for DOS.

ScriptWright Professional is a shareware program for MS-DOS (Meaning it was fully intended for mass distributed or to be shared with a colleague), which I am archiving for future reference here. Maybe I'll include some crude scripts to give stats, maybe. What I make is under the zlib license.
